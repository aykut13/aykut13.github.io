<p> The city, which lies at an elevation of 1,278 metres (4,193 ft) <br>
in the broad valley of the Kızılırmak river,is a moderately-sized <br>
trade center and industrial city, although the economy has traditionally <br>
been based on agriculture.Rail repair shops and a thriving manufacturing <br>
industry of rugs,bricks, cement, and cotton and woolen textiles form the <br>
mainstays of the city's economy. The surrounding region is a cereal-producing<br>
area with large deposits of iron ore which are worked at Divriği. </p>
